# SKILL-380 Subtask 6 - code_review strategy delegated (DelegatedReviewStrategy)

Parent spec: [spec.md](spec.md)
Issue key: SKILL-380

## Scope

Resolves the behavioural half of investigation F-004. Adds the second `code_review`
strategy: the multi-agent review. The dominant pack's specialist subagents review in
parallel through `ParallelCodeReviewRunner`, and their findings are merged. This is the
delegated path of today's `skill-bill code-review`, and the review feature-task used
before commit `d6651d94b` (2026-09-11).

`phase:review mode:delegated` (subtask 8) selects it. The skeleton keeps `inline` for
every mode for now; enabling `delegated` there later is one selection change.

**Reproduce first.** `d6651d94b` removed this path from feature-task because "isolated
findings-only review buffered until exit and hung".

- Before writing the strategy, reproduce that behaviour with a test. Drive
  `ParallelCodeReviewRunner` from the feature-task launch path with a lane agent that
  writes nothing until it exits.
- Record the cause in `runtime-kotlin/agent/decisions.md`.
- Every lane launch must use a bounded progress policy, meaning the read-only idle
  policy with the progress timeout that verify_findings uses, or an equivalent strategy
  on `AgentRunProcessRequest`. A lane that emits nothing before exit must settle as a
  lane failure within that bound.
- If the cause is outside the review runner (for example in the launcher's output
  capture), fix it at its owner. Do not work around it inside the strategy.
- If the hang cannot be reproduced or fixed, block this subtask. Subtask 8 depends on
  it.

**Strategy `DelegatedReviewStrategy` (id `delegated`, slot `code_review`).** In the
`code_review` slot package, beside `InlineReviewStrategy`.

- **review step:** runs through the strategy's own `PhaseRunner` instance. The step
  drives `ParallelCodeReviewRunner` in its delegated lane shape; lane and parent
  launches go through the shared `GoalRunnerSubtaskLauncher` port, as today.
  - The review target is a per-call fact: a commit range in the skeleton, or `HEAD`,
    `uncommitted`, or a commit for `phase:review`. The strategy does not branch on the
    composition.
  - Specialists are routed by the dominant pack; learnings are resolved as SKILL-379
    delivers them.
  - The step returns the uniform output. Its value carries the merged findings; the
    strategy decodes them for the existing `FINDINGS_VERIFICATION_INPUT` handoff, as
    `InlineReviewStrategy` does. The structured finding pipeline behind the runner is
    unchanged (parent Non-goals).
  - It does not edit files. Its review step policy is read-only and not mutating.
- **verify_findings and implement_fix:** composes the step classes subtask 3 extracted.
  Same `review_fix` edge, same cap, same remediation checkpoint. No duplication.
- **State:** review-pass reservation, carry-forward, and caps go through
  `PhaseRunState`.
- **Mode:** the DELEGATED `commit_focused_accounting` gate applies unchanged. The mode
  stays pinned on resume as today.
- **Selection:** register the strategy. Add the `phase:review` mode mapping
  (`delegated` → `delegated`) in subtask 8, not here. The skeleton mapping stays
  `inline` for every accepted mode.

**Docs.** In the ARCHITECTURE.md strategy table, add both review strategies, what each
does, and how the review mode selects them per composition.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. A test reproduces the findings-only hang against the pre-fix code path, and with the fix a lane that writes nothing until exit settles as a lane failure within the configured progress bound.
2. With the skeleton `code_review` selection entry replaced by `delegated` in a test binding, a feature-task run reviews through `ParallelCodeReviewRunner` in the delegated lane shape, the review step edits no files, and verified findings reach implement_fix through the existing `review_fix` edge. The run loop, skeleton, and other strategies are unchanged.
3. `DelegatedReviewStrategy` composes the same verify_findings and implement_fix step classes as `InlineReviewStrategy`.
4. The production skeleton selection still resolves every accepted mode to `inline`, and every subtask 1 fixture still matches.
5. `agent/decisions.md` records the hang's cause and fix. ARCHITECTURE.md documents both review strategies and the mode mapping.

## Non-goals

- Enabling `delegated` in the skeleton's production selection.
- The `review` definition and routing `skill-bill code-review` (subtask 8).
- Replacing `ParallelCodeReviewRunner`'s structured findings with prose (follow-up bundle).
- Re-review after implement_fix. The `review_fix` cap stays 1.
- New specialist areas, rubric changes, or learnings behaviour beyond SKILL-379.
- Changing `ParallelCodeReviewRunner` beyond the hang fix and the inputs this strategy needs.

## Dependency notes

- Depends on subtask 5 (the `code_review` package, shared step classes, and `PhaseRunState` are in place).
- Use the learnings delivery that is on the tree.
- Use the review-preparation type and `AgentRunLaunchFacts` termination that exist now.

## Validation strategy

The regressions to catch:

- the review hanging on a silent lane
- delegated review editing files
- findings not reaching implement_fix
- the skeleton selection changing

What covers them:

- the reproduction test
- a real-SQLite run-loop test with scripted lane agents under a test selection binding
- the subtask 1 fixtures under the production binding

Run `cd runtime-kotlin && ./gradlew check`, plus the engine, application, core, and
launcher suites. Run `bill-unit-test-value-check` on changed tests.
