## [2026-04-24] runtime-mcp-application-routing
Areas: skillbill.mcp, skillbill.application, skillbill.di, architecture tests, MCP tests
- Added `McpComponent` as the MCP Kotlin-Inject composition root over the shared `RuntimeComponent`.
- Routed MCP import, triage, learning resolution, stats, telemetry, version, and doctor calls through application services.
- Kept MCP telemetry-disabled skip payloads and orchestrated payload enrichment in the adapter; application services own shared persistence and payload assembly.
- Reusable pattern: architecture tests now ban MCP from importing DB/review/learnings runtime internals or telemetry runtime implementation APIs for shared workflows.
- Regression coverage compares CLI and MCP system-service payloads for version and doctor while preserving existing MCP payload tests.
Feature flag: N/A
Acceptance criteria: 5/5 implemented

## [2026-04-24] runtime-architecture-phase-0
Areas: runtime-kotlin architecture, RuntimeModule, architecture tests, SKILL-28 spec
- Added `ARCHITECTURE.md` as the runtime boundary map and target dependency-direction contract.
- Added architecture guardrail tests for the doc, declared package boundaries, application entrypoint independence, CLI command delegation, and future domain package infrastructure bans.
- Updated `RuntimeModule` so `application` and `di` are first-class declared subsystem packages.
- Reusable pattern: keep boundary tests scoped to rules true today, and document transitional exceptions such as MCP before enforcing them in later phases.
- Known limitation: MCP still bypasses application services until the planned Phase 1 refactor.
Feature flag: N/A
Acceptance criteria: 3/3 implemented
