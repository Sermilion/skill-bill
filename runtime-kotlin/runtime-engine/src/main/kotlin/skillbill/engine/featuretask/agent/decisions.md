# featuretask runtime boundary decisions

## [2026-09-20] Validate keeps repairing until true
Context: Three honest `validation_passed: false` reports burned the output-gate cap while `./gradlew check` was still red. The agent knew the leftover detekt and Feed failures and stopped because the phase required a boolean handoff.
Decision: Do not emit until `validation_passed` is true. Keep repairing in the same session. False is not a successful handoff: continue only when the remaining-failure text shrank; block when leftovers stay the same. Wall-clock timeout still stops the subtask. Malformed JSON retries twice.
Reason: The operator chose a remaining-set stall over a false boolean as the stop. Raising the envelope cap would not finish a huge leftover pile, and treating false as schema failure hid real check work.
Supersedes: Validate discovers project checks and retries up to three times (2026-09-20)

## [2026-09-20] Commit_push does not block on validate tree fingerprint
Context: After validate, the worktree fingerprint no longer matched the capture. commit_push treated that as stale identity and blocked instead of committing.
Decision: A validate-era tree fingerprint that no longer matches the worktree is not a commit_push block, including HEAD that moved by committing that tree. Stage every uncommitted and unstaged dirty path and commit. Base-ref identity still blocks.
Reason: The operator said the fingerprint mismatch is not a block reason and required the uncommitted, unstaged tree to land.

## [2026-09-20] Validate discovers project checks and retries up to three times
Context: Pack `validation_gate` argv, including cache-bypassing collect-all, told the agent which command to run. That is a platform-pack recipe, not the project's own checks. The operator rejected pack-defined validate commands.
Decision: The validate agent discovers commands from the repository (instructions, build and test config, scripts, CI). It does not run pack `validation_gate` argv or `bill-code-check`. It repairs and reruns those project checks up to three times in session, then returns boolean `produced_outputs.validation_passed`. False, missing, or malformed output relaunches the phase up to three times. Runtime does not rerun the checks. Commit_push readiness selects project CI checks only, not pack collect-all.
Reason: The project's AGENTS.md, Gradle, and CI are the source of truth. A pack flag such as `--no-build-cache` is not a project command. Three occupancies keep a repair window without substituting pack argv for discovery.
Supersedes: Validate reruns the pack gate up to three times (2026-09-20)
Superseded by: Validate keeps repairing until true (2026-09-20)

## [2026-09-20] Validate reruns the pack gate up to three times
Context: After validate reported a boolean success, commit_push blocked on readiness check `pack-collect-all` with no repair occupancy. The 2026-09-19 boolean-only phase trusted the agent and reran the phase once on false; it did not rerun the pack gate.
Decision: Validate is again runtime-owned: each occupancy invokes `bill-code-check` to fix the open set, then the runtime reruns the pack cache-bypassing collect-all gate. Repeat until the gate is green or three verify reruns are exhausted. `MAX_REPAIR_TURNS` is 3. A green runtime confirmation, not `validation_passed`, advances the phase. Paused launches and `needs_user_action` still stop immediately.
Reason: The operator required the validation phase to rerun gates up to three times to fix remaining findings before commit_push. A boolean envelope cannot stand in for pack-collect-all.
Supersedes: Validate returns a boolean project check result (2026-09-19)
Superseded by: Validate discovers project checks and retries up to three times (2026-09-20)

## [2026-09-19] Validate returns a boolean project check result
Context: Projects choose their own checks and environments. A runtime command receipt added detail without proving execution, and a second runtime check duplicated phase work.
Decision: The agent discovers and runs project checks, repairs failures, and returns boolean `produced_outputs.validation_passed` with details in `value`. True advances. False, missing, or malformed output gets one retry, then blocks. Process failures retain their separate bounded retry policy. Resume and goal status use the same boolean. Runtime never infers success from command strings or exit codes.
Reason: The user explicitly chose to trust the phase result. This is an orchestration signal, not execution attestation. Readiness still tracks its existing selected checks against repository identity after a successful phase.
Superseded by: Validate reruns the pack gate up to three times (2026-09-20)

## [2026-09-19] Validate relies on the phase check
Context: The validate agent invoked `bill-code-check`, which confirmed its repairs, then the runtime ran the same cache-bypassing gate again.
Decision: `bill-code-check` owns check execution, repairs, and confirmation. The runtime accepts the phase's command and exit-code evidence through the existing output gate and persists completion without another gate execution. Runtime execution counts remain zero for new phase-owned checks. Validate allows two output attempts, with one correction after a rejected result. The phase owns pack selection and the confirmation command, so runtime does not compare its receipt with a separately routed command. The goal stops when those attempts fail and requires an operator resume instead of adding its own validation retries.
Reason: The user chose to rely on the phase check and remove duplicate verification. Failed processes, blocked results, missing evidence, and failed confirmation evidence still prevent completion.
Superseded by: Validate returns a boolean project check result (2026-09-19)

## [2026-09-19] SKILL-364 sibling readiness evidence contract
Context: Validate-owned `validation_evidence` records pack gate commands only; commit and PR progression needed a separate durable record for tree identity, base ref, workflow-selected checks, and per-check results without bumping the validation contract.
Decision: Add `readiness_evidence` as a sibling contract and workflow artifact (`FEATURE_TASK_RUNTIME_READINESS_EVIDENCE_ARTIFACT_KEY`). Validate still owns pack collect-all execution; commit_push owns readiness settlement and persistence.
Reason: Mixing PR/plugin readiness into validation evidence would break Issue 341 / 0AC-16 settlement and blur phase ownership.
Revisit when: a single envelope can subsume both without a contract bump.

## [2026-09-19] SKILL-364 write-tree identity versus checkpoint fingerprint
Context: `repositoryCheckpointFingerprint` hashes owned paths for validate receipts; commit readiness must ignore boundary `agent/history.md` and this run's `.skill-bill/run-evidence/<workflow-id>/` paths.
Decision: `source_tree_sha` is `git write-tree` on a copied index with those paths removed; `base_ref_sha` is `origin/<baseBranch>`. Checkpoint fingerprint semantics stay unchanged.
Reason: History and run-evidence are allowed post-validate output; folding them into source identity would force needless reruns or accept unvalidated source edits.
Revisit when: checkpoint fingerprint is retired or run-evidence addressing changes.

## [2026-09-19] SKILL-364 failed commit_push readiness rerun is needs_user_action
Context: A failed or missing selected check at commit_push must not reopen validate or add repair occupancy.
Decision: Readiness failures block commit_push with `needs_user_action`; resume retries readiness on the same dirty tree with `last_resumable_step=commit_push`.
Reason: Validate already spent its repair budget; commit_push is the PR-readiness boundary.
Revisit when: readiness gains its own bounded repair loop.

## [2026-09-18] commit_push does not launch an agent
Context: Agents emitted two phase-output envelopes on `commit_push`, and the schema gate blocked a non-retrying phase. The only agent field the runtime consumed was a commit subject; staging, commit, push, and `commit_sha` were already runtime-owned.
Decision: `commit_push` skips the agent launch. The runtime stages every dirty non-ignored path, commits with a subject from the issue key and subtask name, pushes, and persists `commit_sha`. Downstream readers still use `commit_push_result.commit_sha`.
Reason: A subject string is not worth a structured agent turn. Double JSON at a non-retrying gate stranded finished subtasks.
Revisit when: commit subjects need human-authored outcome text that the manifest subtask name cannot carry.

## [2026-09-17] Audit repair cycles stay in one session and remaining text carries a reason
Context: Auditors inspected once, emitted remaining ACs with no why, and the runtime relaunched. Three runtime relaunches would recreate the remaining-criteria storm.
Decision: The audit briefing asks for up to three repair cycles inside the same agent session. Remaining-criteria text that is not `[]` includes a reason per leftover criterion. That briefing is runtime-owned and identical for every dominant platform pack; packs do not author remaining-criteria settlement. The runtime still treats any non-empty remaining text as unstructured prose: no schema on that list, one outer remaining-criteria retry, then block when the text is unchanged.
Reason: Cycle count and reasons are instructions to the agent. Enforcing them in the envelope would be a new contract. Relaunching the process is the bounded outer retry, not the inner loop.
Revisit when: remaining-criteria settlement grows a structured per-cycle field.

## [2026-09-17] Remaining-criteria audit retries repair beyond implement owned paths
Context: Implement can checkpoint a narrow `scoped_owned_paths` list. Audit then treated that list as a write allowlist, re-emitted the same remaining ACs, and the runtime relaunched with the old checkpoint forever.
Decision: Remaining-criteria text is a focus hint on a fresh audit session that may edit any files those criteria require. Audit extends the owned-path inventory and checkpoints those writes before the next round. The same remaining list as the prior session blocks.
Reason: The remaining-AC loop is repair, not a frozen re-read of implement. Identical leftover text with no progress is a stall, not another session.
Revisit when: remaining-criteria settlement is a topology edge with a declared per-edge cap.

## [2026-09-16] commit_push has no extra-files category
Context: The commit_push briefing told agents never to list `.feature-specs/` in `changed_paths`, and finalisation dropped those paths from the staged set. Agents then emitted two envelopes to "fix" the list, which blocked a non-retrying phase. Spec moves such as `.feature-specs/done/` were left uncommitted.
Decision: The agent may list every dirty path. Finalisation stages every dirty non-ignored path, including `.feature-specs/`. Goal-level leftover spec dirt after the parent records `commit_sha` stays ignored at goal finalize so same-branch completion does not block on that post-commit write.
Reason: There is no extra-files category. Spec trees are worktree output of the subtask. The briefing that carved them out caused a double emit and stranded deliverable spec moves.
Revisit when: the parent stops writing the decomposition manifest after the subtask commit.

## [2026-09-15] SKILL-247 subtask 3 — run-loop helper dependency baseline and after-state
Context: F-005 documented 122 context extensions and duplicate PlanningBranch run-loop overloads; subtask 3 narrows PlanningBranch, Drive, ValidationGate, AttemptSettlement, Review, and PhaseAttempts seams without changing phase order.
Decision: Record before/after extension counts and retained broad inputs in `runtime-kotlin/ARCHITECTURE.md` under State Ownership; peel run-loop-only overloads; keep `runPhaseDriveLoop` and `invalidateReviewGenerationIfNeeded` as the only Drive context extensions; pass carried-forward review, gate settlement, pack routing, and checkpoint calculations through explicit arguments; retain context at validation agent-turn/fix-loop orchestration and review launch capture because those paths still coordinate the launch, activity, diagnostics, clock, transition, and session ports; remove public collaborator aliases on `FeatureTaskRuntimeRunLoop`.
Reason: Helpers must not gain authority through a renamed all-access receiver; the loop stays the sole owner of forward drive and session transitions.
Revisit when: a new helper needs a full context and no smaller port set can be named.

## [2026-09-15] Run-evidence ownership derives from the active run, not the store prefix
Context: every path under `.skill-bill/` was runtime-private, so the whole `run-evidence` store was exempt from the owned-path inventory. This run's own artifacts never blocked, but a foreign workflow's artifact and a file forged under the same directory were swept out with them.
Decision: `isRuntimePrivatePath` no longer claims `.skill-bill/run-evidence`. The checkpoint scope resolves ownership from the active run's identity against the deterministic publication address `.skill-bill/run-evidence/<workflow-id>/<fingerprint>/`. Only this run's own address is runtime-owned; anything else under the store root stays an ordinary actionable path.
Reason: the exemption was load-bearing in one direction only. A prefix-free rule blocks the run's own evidence; a blanket prefix rule silently absorbs someone else's file. The address the store already writes carries the provenance both directions need.
Alternatives considered: a durable published-inventory port read at checkpoint time (rejected for now: the publication address is already deterministic from workflow id and checkpoint fingerprint, so a second durable authority would restate it).
Revisit when: the store stops addressing artifacts by workflow id, or a run must adopt evidence published under another workflow's address.

## [2026-09-15] A verification boundary needs an observed lane disposition, not just empty claims
Context: a review pass that produced no output at all reached `emptyClaimsVerificationShortCircuit` with no claims and a blank prose input, which recorded `VERIFICATION` as REACHED. A lane that never ran was indistinguishable from a lane that genuinely found nothing.
Decision: `ParallelReviewLaneStatus` carries the pass's `ReviewLaneReviewDisposition`. The verification boundary is recorded only when the lane succeeded, was not interrupted, and published output. Otherwise the stage returns a typed `ReviewVerificationNonSuccess` that preserves existing findings and durable verdicts and leaves the boundary unreached.
Reason: `mergeResult.formattedOutput` substitutes a placeholder for blank lane output, so the absence signal was already erased by the time verification read it. The disposition has to be carried from where it is observed.
Revisit when: a review mode can legitimately complete a pass without publishing any output.

## [2026-09-15] SKILL-236 missing-terminal and PR-failure observations: reproduction disposition
Context: subtask 3 owns recording which of the reported missing-terminal-outcome and PR-failure observations reproduce inside its scope.
Decision: Reproduced and repaired here — the verification stage boundary reached on an empty or failed review pass, and the evidence broker's unconditional `repeated_evidence_read` refusal. Governed by SKILL-235's landed decision and receipt reconciliation (commit 93370d75d) — terminal decision and repair-receipt finalisation; this subtask reuses it and adds no second finalisation authority. Unreproduced and claimed unrepaired — the historical PR-step failures, which no fixture in this scope reproduces.
Reason: claiming a repair for a failure class nobody reproduced would put a false clearance in the very telemetry this feature exists to make truthful.
Revisit when: a reproduction fixture for the PR-step failures lands, at which point the repair belongs with SKILL-235's finalisation authority rather than here.

## [2026-09-11] Active subtask owns every dirty path
Context: commit_push blocked needs_human when any dirty file was missing from the frozen ownership inventory, including required `agent/history.md` writes.
Decision: The active subtask owns every non-runtime-private dirty path. Checkpoints and commit_push stage them. Review identity does not treat extra dirt as foreign.
Reason: The inventory was a branch-setup snapshot, so later legal writes looked like someone else's work and stalled the goal. Operator intent is that whatever is dirty on this subtask is this subtask's.
Revisit when: a run must share a worktree with a second in-flight subtask that must keep its own uncommitted files out of this commit.

## [2026-09-10] write_history and commit_push never reopen earlier phases
Context: After the bounded review_fix round, implement_fix leaves owned dirty files. commit_push treated that as a stale review, wiped audit and later phases, and the drive loop bounced back to audit.
Decision: `write_history` and `commit_push` stay forward-only. Owned implement/implement_fix paths plus declared boundary-history may be finalised. Foreign dirty content blocks needs_human. Matching subtask trailer on HEAD keeps review identity across tree drift.
Reason: The shipped topology already allows only `audit_gap` and `review_fix`. Replaying audit/review from finalisation discarded a completed review-fix round and could not converge while the same owned files stayed dirty.
Alternatives considered: Keep re-entering audit for any non-history dirty path (rejected: infinite bounce after a legal implement_fix). Stage history-only and leave implement_fix files dirty (rejected: the bounded fix round would never land).
Revisit when: a later phase needs a declared backward edge, which would be a topology change rather than a finalisation side path.
Superseded by: Active subtask owns every dirty path (2026-09-11)
