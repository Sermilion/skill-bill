      Your previous attempt was rejected for length alone — its content was not disputed, so restating the
      same case at the same length will be rejected again. Shorten what you already claimed: keep the
      conclusion and one concrete anchor (a checkpoint fingerprint, a count of changed paths, a single
      representative path), and drop per-file walkthroughs, reasoning narration, and quoted output. If a
      segment applied no edits, say that it applied none and why it was already satisfied — the absence of
      work is shorter to report than to prove. Move any remaining detail into the schema-authorized
