# Slot baseline fixtures

These files record the runtime's behaviour before the SKILL-380 phase-slot
refactor. Later subtasks diff against them. Every difference must match an
entry in the
[fixture ledger](../../../../../../../.feature-specs/SKILL-380-phase-slot-strategies/spec.md#fixture-ledger).

Harness sources live in
`runtime-engine/src/test/kotlin/skillbill/engine/featuretask/slotbaseline/`.

## Bundles and the harness entry behind each

| Directory | Entry | What runs |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `standalone/` | `SlotBaselineFullRunCapture.standalone()` | A full feature-task runtime run with no goal continuation |
| `goal-child-build/` | `SlotBaselineFullRunCapture.goalChildBuild()` | Goal child for subtask 1 at the BUILD gate (`kotlinPackWithBuildGate`) |
| `goal-child-validate/` | `SlotBaselineFullRunCapture.goalChildValidate()` | Goal child for subtask 2 at the VALIDATE gate (`kotlinPackWithValidationGate`) |
| `goal-planning/` | `SlotBaselineGoalPlanningCapture.encodedFiles()` | `DefaultGoalPlanningSweep` preplan and plan over a two-subtask manifest, then `GoalPlanningLogService.log` |
| `code-review/` | `SlotBaselineCodeReviewCapture.encodedFiles()` | `parallelCodeReviewRunnerOf` in INLINE and DELEGATED mode |
| `mcp-lifecycle/` | `SlotBaselineMcpLifecycleCapture.encodedFiles()` | `LifecycleTelemetryService`, the service the MCP tools call |

Full-run bundles run through `telemetryRunnerHarness` against real SQLite.
The phase launcher is `satisfiedAuditLauncher()`. The review step runs
`InlineReviewStrategy` with a `DefaultPhaseRunner` over a recording launcher. Each bundle
contains:

- `workflow-snapshot.json`: the `workflow_states` row, with `steps_json` and `artifacts_json` parsed
- `phase-records.json` and `ledger-entries.json`
- `handoff-projections.json` and `run-invariants.json`: the matching artifact families
- `feature-task-runtime-finished.json`: the last `feature_task_runtime_finished` outbox payload
- `prompts/<step>.txt`: every prompt the agents received, keyed by `phaseIdFromPrompt`. The review prompt goes in `prompts/review.txt`.

`goal-planning/` holds:

- `preplan-prompt.txt`
- `plan-prompts.json`, keyed by subtask id
- `shared-preplan-checkpoint.json`: `goal_shared_preplans` rows
- `plan-records.json`: `goal_subtask_plans` rows
- `planning-attempt-log.json`: progress events in persistence wire form
- `planning-log.json`

`code-review/` holds, for each mode:

- `inline-output.json` and `delegated-output.json`: the result fields the CLI prints
- `review-runs-*.json`: every `review_*` table
- `review-telemetry-*.json`: `telemetry_outbox` rows

`mcp-lifecycle/` holds the outbox payloads for `quality_check_started`,
`quality_check_finished` and `pr_description_generated`.

## Pinned ids and clock

- Workflow id: `wftr-20260602-test-0001` (`WORKFLOW_ID`)
- Parent workflow id: `wfl-skill-380-parent`
- Review run ids: `rvw-20260602-120000-inln` and `rvw-20260602-120000-dlgt`
- Review session ids: `rvs-slot-baseline-inln` and `rvs-slot-baseline-dlgt`
- SQLite clock: fixed at `2026-06-02T12:00:00Z` (`SlotBaselineFullRunCapture.sqliteClock`)

Every capture gets a fresh repo root, `skillbill-slot-baseline-repo-*`, and a
fresh home, `skillbill-slot-baseline-home-*`, both under `java.io.tmpdir`.
They are deleted afterwards.

## Normaliser tokens

`SlotBaselineNormalizer` replaces values that differ between runs.

By map key:

- `__NORMALIZED_TIMESTAMP__` replaces non-null values of `started_at`, `updated_at`, `finished_at`, `first_started_at`, `timestamp`, `heartbeat_at`, `expires_at` and `recorded_at`
- `__NORMALIZED_DURATION__` replaces non-null values of `duration_millis`, `duration_ms` and `duration_seconds`
- `__NORMALIZED_SESSION_ID__` replaces a non-blank string `session_id`
- `__NORMALIZED_REVIEW_RUN_ID__` replaces a string `review_run_id`
- `__NORMALIZED_EVENT_UUID__` replaces a string `event_uuid`

In any string, in this order:

1. `__NORMALIZED_REPO_ROOT__` replaces `<tmpdir>/skillbill-slot-baseline-repo-<digits>`. Both the absolute and the real-path form of tmpdir match.
2. `__NORMALIZED_TEMP_PATH__` replaces any other first-level path under tmpdir.
3. `__NORMALIZED_TIMESTAMP__` replaces ISO instants (`2026-06-02T12:00:00Z`, with optional fractional seconds).
4. `__NORMALIZED_TIMESTAMP__` replaces SQLite datetimes (`2026-06-02 12:00:00`).
5. `__NORMALIZED_SHA64__` replaces 64-hex-digit hashes.
6. `__NORMALIZED_SHA40__` replaces 40-hex-digit hashes.
7. `__NORMALIZED_REVIEW_RUN_ID__` replaces `rvw-<8 digits>-<6 digits>-<suffix>`.

## Canonicalisations

- Map keys are sorted.
- Enums are written as their `wireValue`, or as `name` when they have none.
- JSON strings stored in SQLite columns are parsed and embedded as JSON.
- Structured values are pretty-printed JSON with a trailing newline.
- Text files are normalised, trailing whitespace is trimmed, and one final newline is added.
- If a step prompts the agent more than once, the prompts are joined with `\n---\n` in launch order.

## Steps with no prompt

Some steps have no file under `prompts/`:

- `commit_push` runs inside the runtime and launches no agent.
- A gate that passes on the first try launches no repair agent.

Only steps that sent a prompt to an agent get a file.

## Output format

The CLI renderers `renderPlanningLog` and `writeParallelReviewResult` belong
to runtime-cli, and runtime-engine tests cannot reach them. So instead of
rendered CLI text, these fixtures record:

- `planning-log.json`: the payload `GoalPlanningLogCommand` prints under JSON output
- `*-output.json`: the `ParallelCodeReviewResult` fields that `writeParallelReviewResult` prints

## Regenerating

Run the capture twice, from `runtime-kotlin`, each time in a fresh Gradle
invocation:

```
SKILL_BILL_SLOTBASELINE_CAPTURE=1 ./gradlew :runtime-engine:test --tests skillbill.engine.featuretask.slotbaseline.SlotBaselineCaptureTest
```

After the second run, `git status --porcelain` on this directory should match
the first. The writer skips this README and replaces every bundle directory.
When the variable is not set, the capture test is skipped. Two tests always
run:

- `SlotBaselineCaptureTest.consecutiveCapturesProduceByteIdenticalTree` checks that the capture is deterministic.
- `SlotBaselineFixtureTest` checks that the committed files match a live capture byte for byte.

## Using the fixtures in later subtasks

To compare a live value with a committed file, encode the value with
`SlotBaselineJson.encode` and call:

```kotlin
SlotBaselineFixtureCompare.assertBytesEqual("featuretask/slotbaseline/standalone/phase-records.json", actual)
```

If the bytes differ, the call fails and prints a line diff. Any change the
ledger expects must be regenerated in the subtask that the ledger names.

## Re-baselined changes

- Subtask 4 (skeleton definitions and quality gate): `standalone/prompts/validate.txt`
  and `goal-child-validate/prompts/validate.txt` carry the validate uniform-output
  directive (settle completed, or blocked with a progress or no_progress verdict) in
  place of the `validation_passed` directive. This is the ledger's allowed validate
  prompt change. Every other file is unchanged.
