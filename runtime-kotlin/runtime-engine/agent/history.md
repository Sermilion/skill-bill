## [2026-09-26] SKILL-380 subtask 1 — Pre-change behaviour fixtures
Areas: runtime-kotlin/runtime-engine/src/test/{kotlin/skillbill/engine/{featuretask/slotbaseline,goalrunner/planning/sweep},resources/featuretask/slotbaseline}
- Added a pre-refactor baseline for the phase-slot-strategy work: committed fixtures for the standalone run, goal-child build and validate runs, goal planning, parallel code review (INLINE and DELEGATED), and MCP lifecycle telemetry. The fixtures cover phase records, handoff projections, ledger entries, run invariants, workflow snapshots, and per-phase prompts.
- `SlotBaselineFixtureTest` compares a live capture against every committed fixture. `SlotBaselineCaptureTest` checks that two consecutive captures are byte-identical. It also holds the writer, which runs only when `SKILL_BILL_SLOTBASELINE_CAPTURE=1`. reusable
- To regenerate fixtures after an intended behaviour change, rerun the gated writer and review the diff. The README lists every normaliser token and the parent spec's fixture ledger.
- Pattern: each capture runs against a temp repo root and home, real SQLite, and the real validator. `SlotBaselineNormalizer` replaces paths, ids, and timestamps with fixed tokens so the output is deterministic.
- The goal-planning sweep test doubles (launcher, manifest store, invariants source, context discovery) moved to the shared `GoalPlanningSweepTestFixtures.kt`, which the capture harness reuses. Test behaviour is unchanged. reusable
- Limitation: runtime-engine tests can't reach the runtime-cli renderers, so goal-planning ships `planning-log.json` rather than rendered text, and the code-review outputs are result JSON, not CLI text.
- Limitation: the prompt sets follow what the live loop launches. None of the captured runs includes a commit_push or implement_fix prompt, and goal children have no pr prompt. No `src/main` file changed.

## [2026-09-26] SKILL-378 subtask 3 — Goal-runner sequences, reads, and silent reads
Areas: runtime-kotlin/runtime-engine/skillbill/engine/{goalrunner/{execution/core,findings,persist,planning/{recovery,remedies},repair,status},featuretask/{phase/record,persist,runner,lifecycle/continuation}}, runtime-kotlin/runtime-domain/skillbill/{goalrunner,workflow/model/goalreview}, runtime-kotlin/runtime-contracts/skillbill/error/shellcontent
- Observability sequence numbers are allocated only by the durable in-transaction issue-wide max+1; no engine class keeps a counter, a `var sequence`, or a per-workflow sequence map.
- `patchForEvent` now takes a `(Int) -> GoalObservabilityEvent` builder instead of a pre-built event, so the allocated number is the single source of `sequenceNumber` and no construction site can silently default it to 0. reusable
- New read-only `FeatureTaskRuntimePhaseQuery` (featuretask/phase/record) splits phase reads from the writing recorder; the four goal-runner readers (status projection assembler, stop reports, repair coordinator, child-aware refresh liveness) depend on the query, and only the rejection recorder still holds the writing facade. reusable
- Pattern: route best-effort seams through `GoalRunnerBestEffortEmission.runCancellable {}` + `rethrowIfCancellation` rather than hand-rolled `catch (e: Exception)` — it rethrows cancellation, restores the interrupt flag, and keeps warning wording consistent across seams (also what satisfies detekt `TooGenericExceptionCaught`).
- Four former silent reads (unaddressed-findings ledger schema, child refresh liveness, preplan prose read, rejection write failure) now fail typed or degrade to a recorded seam with a bounded warning, each covered by a malformed-input test.
- `InvalidUnaddressedFindingsLedgerSchemaError` gained an optional `cause`; `ShellContentContractException` already supported it, so no call sites changed.
- Limitation: the fifth silent read (`runCatching` over `goalObservabilityLatestEventFromArtifacts` in `WorkflowGoalRunnerProgressRecording.progress`) and the inject-property exposure of `GoalRunnerStatusProjectionDataSources` are left to the goal-runner follow-up.
- Limitation: `phaseQuery` is public, not `internal` — runtime-engine `testFixtures` is a separate compilation without friend access to main internals.

## [2026-09-25] SKILL-378 subtask 2 — Feature-task run-loop step classes
Areas: runtime-kotlin/runtime-engine/skillbill/engine/featuretask/runloop/{core,phase,output,settlement,checkpoint,state}, runtime-kotlin/runtime-core/repoTest/skillbill/architecture
- Broke the 20-node mutual-reference cycle across the feature-task run-loop step objects; the declaration graph now has 23 nodes and no strongly connected component larger than one.
- New step owners: `PhaseBlocking` (runloop/phase) holds block and phase-state-read primitives, `ValidationScope` (runloop/settlement) holds validation changed-paths and the single pack build command, `ReviewCompletion` (runloop/output) holds goal-review detection and review completion persisters.
- Added an architecture guard asserting run-loop step declarations reference each other acyclically, plus a synthetic two-node fixture proving the census names both members of a mutual pair.
- Guard reuses the existing `stronglyConnectedComponents` scan via `ArchitectureScanSupport.cyclicComponents` rather than a second scanner; `CommentStripper` moved private -> internal and gained a defaulted `blankStringLiterals` flag so the default path stays byte-identical. reusable
- Pattern: strip comments and string literals before building a declaration-reference graph — observability seam literals otherwise forge false edges and re-form the cycle.
- Legacy SQLite busy-reason text matching is now one named constant consumed at the two resume sites; it classifies persisted historical blocked reasons, not live failures (typed `DatabaseBusyError` remains the live disposition).
- Limitation: guard is host-classed in `RuntimeEnginePublicTopLevelDeclarationArchitectureTest`; the carrier class `FeatureTaskRuntimeRunLoopSession` stays in the node set as a zero-out-edge sink rather than being name-excluded.

## [2026-09-17] SKILL-352 subtask 3 — Record fallbacks, restore ownership, and shrink surface
Areas: runtime-kotlin/{runtime-engine,runtime-domain,runtime-ports,runtime-application,runtime-infra-sqlite,runtime-core}
- Goal-runner durable-read fallbacks now emit bounded diagnostics and project degraded status; lease timestamps and closed runtime vocabularies use typed domain values.
- Consolidated best-effort diagnostic emission, removed the engine JSON scanner, and moved engine-only declarations behind their producing boundary while narrowing public surface.
- Pattern: keep fallback recording, projection degradation, and ownership decisions at typed runtime seams. reusable
- Limitation: the full engine visibility census and test-class/prose-assertion split remain partial follow-up work.
Feature flag: N/A
Acceptance criteria: 6/8 implemented

## [2026-09-17] SKILL-352 subtask 2 — One persistence seam and typed durable failures
Areas: runtime-kotlin/{runtime-application,runtime-contracts,runtime-core,runtime-domain,runtime-engine,runtime-infra-fs,runtime-infra-sqlite}
- Consolidated feature-task workflow artifact reads and writes behind the runtime-engine persistence owner and removed recorder role-interface bundles.
- Routed goal-planning and review-policy artifact decoding through declared wire-key owners, typed durable errors, and non-null domain decoder overloads.
- Pattern: keep artifact encoding, decoding, and persistence patches at one typed runtime boundary. reusable
- Limitation: several shared-context integrity paths still use `require`/`error`; unsupported packet versions use the typed failure path.
Feature flag: N/A
Acceptance criteria: 7/7 implemented

## [2026-09-14] WE-4789 — Validation gate execution evidence
Areas: orchestration/contracts, runtime-kotlin/{runtime-contracts,runtime-domain,runtime-engine,runtime-infra-fs,runtime-infra-sqlite,runtime-cli,runtime-ports}
- Validation gate settlement now projects `executed_work_units`, `executed_checks`, and top-level `checks` from `ValidationGateRunResult` instead of discarding gate task identities at the coordinator seam.
- Gradle packs derive stable `module|task` identities from `> Task` stdout lines even when actionable-summary work units are zero; explicit empty `executed_checks` distinguishes truthful zero-work from legacy evidence loss.
- Goal status and workflow status read the same `validation_result` gate execution evidence as the settled validate artifact; issue 341 command/exit verdict rules are unchanged.
- Pattern: one typed `FeatureTaskRuntimeValidationGateExecutionEvidence` projection across runner, settlement, persistence, and status surfaces. reusable
Feature flag: N/A
Acceptance criteria: 8/8 implemented

## [2026-09-13] Issue 342 — Repair lease and pause clearance
Areas: runtime-kotlin/{runtime-engine/runtime-cli/runtime-ports}/goalrunner
- Added durable stale parent execution-lease, stale child worker-lease, and runner-interrupted pause wedge diagnosis and repair.
- Repair apply clears stale leases and pause residue only without a live unexpired owner, preserves operator_stop, and retains LIVE_LEASE_REFUSED safety semantics.
- CLI inspect and apply output names wedge classes and affected workflow ids without exposing storage tables.
- Pattern: keep parent and child wedge diagnosis/apply flows explicit and reuse the existing live-owner refusal boundary. reusable
- Regression coverage includes engine and CLI fixtures matching the issue 342 manual database workaround.
- Limitation: contract-version hard reset, review-base recovery, and existing child phase-output wedge behavior remain outside this change.
Feature flag: N/A

## [2026-09-13] Issue 341 — Validate evidence integrity
Areas: orchestration/contracts, runtime-kotlin/{runtime-domain,runtime-engine,runtime-infra-fs,runtime-infra-sqlite}
- Validation settlement now consumes schema-backed command and exit-code evidence, requires the required command to exit `0`, and keeps red or missing evidence incomplete across persistence and resume.
- The existing repair path receives remaining validation findings after a red result; repeated unchanged findings and exhausted repair budget remain durable blockers.
- Goal status projects valid command/exit evidence and reports an integrity problem when completed evidence is absent or invalid.
- Pattern: keep one minimal validation-evidence projection across contract, domain, settlement, persistence, and status seams; provider metadata remains opaque. reusable
- Limitation: platform validation routing and review, build, and planning evidence contracts are unchanged.
Feature flag: N/A
Acceptance criteria: 11/11 implemented

## [2026-09-11] SKILL-233 subtask 8 — Engine module and package roots
Areas: runtime-kotlin/{runtime-engine,runtime-application,runtime-infra-fs,runtime-infra-sqlite,runtime-contracts,runtime-core,runtime-cli,runtime-mcp,runtime-domain,runtime-ports,agent,ARCHITECTURE.md}
- Extracted feature-task, goal-runner, goal-planning, and planning-projection runtime behavior into the `runtime-engine` module under one `skillbill.engine` root, with a pinned inbound API and no reverse application dependency. reusable
- Moved infrastructure and application packages to their owning roots, using explicit schema-path constants at validator seams so resource lookup remains stable after package relocation. reusable
- Pattern: record module edges and package ownership in one catalog plus architecture tests, and keep empty per-module baselines as proof that new root violations are rejected rather than suppressed. reusable
- Limitation: the extraction and package moves preserve behavior and signatures; further engine subdivision remains outside this change.
Feature flag: N/A
